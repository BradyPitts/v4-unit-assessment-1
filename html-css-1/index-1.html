      <h2>About HTML5</h2>
      <img id="HTML5" src="HTML5.png" alt="HTML5 img" />
      <p>
        HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the Wourld Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is  a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
        <br><br>
        HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other nwe features; to keep teh laguage both easily readable by humans and consistenly understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backwards-compatable with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

      <h2>About CSS3</h2>
      <img id="CSS3" src="CSS3.png" alt="CSS3 img" />
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        <br>
        <br>
        CSS is designed to enable the seperation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This seperation can improve content accesability, provide more flexability and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multipe web pages to share formatting by specifying th relevant CSS is a seperate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in teh structural content. Seperation of formating adn content also makes it feasable to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accesed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
        <br>
        <br>
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documnets. In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
